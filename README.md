# WsProxy
Proxy client's connections through WebSocket tunnel, to bypass firewall restrictions. If you can only connect to internet via HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket, use this proxy, and then you can connect to everywhere, on any ports.

There are 2 main components:
- Http/Https/Socks5 proxy run on client side
- Self-host ASPX websocket run on server side
